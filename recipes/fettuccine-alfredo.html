        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2 text-gray-600">Description</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">This is a recipe that I created by modifying my mother's recipe. I must warn you,
            this
            recipe is not
            for the health conscious. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2 text-gray-600 mb-2">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6">
            <li>24 ounces dry fettuccini pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>¾ pint heavy cream</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2 text-gray-600 mb-2">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6">
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or
                until al dente;
                drain.</li>
            <li> In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in
                cheese over medium
                heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.

            </li>
            <li>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly
                coated. Serve
                immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with
                sauce and ending with mozzarella)
                until the lasagna is assembled.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an
                hour. Remove the foil and continue
                baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
