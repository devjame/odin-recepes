        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2 text-gray-600 mb-2">Ingredients</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 italic mb-4">These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated
            homemade lasagna recipe:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6">
            <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½
                pound lean ground beef).</li>
            <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of
                garlic.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried
                oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked
                noodles, but you can use the
                oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need
                shredded mozzarella.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which
                means they hold the layer
                together).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4 text-gray-600">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6">
            <li><strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the
                onion and continue cooking until
                it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons
                of salt,
                oregano, and sugar.</li>
            <li>
                <strong> Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al
                dente.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the cheese layer: </strong>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining
                parsley, the remaining salt, and
                pepper in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with
                sauce and ending with mozzarella)
                until the lasagna is assembled.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an
                hour. Remove the foil and continue
                baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
